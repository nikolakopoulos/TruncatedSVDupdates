# TruncatedSVDupdates
Projection techniques to update the truncated SVD of evolving matrices with applications


In this work we present a new algorithm to update the truncatedSVD of evolving matrices, i.e., matrices which are periodically augmented with a new set of rows (and/or columns). The proposed algorithm undertakes a projection viewpoint and builds a pair of subspaces which approximate the linear span of the sought singular vectors of the evolving matrix.

For a complete description of the algorithm, please see our paper:
